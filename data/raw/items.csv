ELA,1,"Most people believe that an action that helps many is preferable to one that helps only a few. This philosophy—that the most ethical action is the one that benefits the greatest number of people—is called utilitarianism. Taxation is a common example of utilitarianism: though we lose some of our money to taxes each year, that money is used to help society as a whole by supporting free public schools, fire and police services, safe roads, and so on. However, utilitarianism is not a perfect system. Taken to the extreme, it can have __deleterious__ effects. For example, stealing someone’s entire life savings to donate to charity might be utilitarian, since it helps a large number of people. But few people would think the theft was fair to the now penniless victim!

What is the meaning of deleterious, as it is used in the passage?
","Correct answers will recognize that deleterious is an adjective that means harmful, detrimental, or negative in the context of the passage. The answer must not be ""deleterious"".

ELA,2,"Groundwater, which is water that exists underground, provides nearly half the world’s supply of drinking water. But if we keep removing water from the ground at the current rate, both drinking water and food supplies will rapidly dwindle in the coming decades. If groundwater usage continues to increase, communities worldwide could suffer from shortages of food and water. Luckily, smart policy choices and scientific advances can help reverse groundwater losses. A local government in Thailand’s Bangkok Basin came up with an ingenious system to track citizens’ groundwater usage, enabling individuals to monitor and reduce their consumption of groundwater. Innovative technologies like automotive irrigation systems and drip lines that can deliver smaller amounts of water directly to plants’ roots have also proven to effectively reduce groundwater use. These promising techniques suggest that the future of groundwater may be brighter than we imagine.

Based on the author’s use of words like luckily, innovative, and promising, what is the tone of the passage?
","Correct answers will recognize that the overall tone of the passage is hopeful and optimistic.
","Correct answers will likely be a word or phrase that is synonymous with hopeful, e.g., hopeful, optimistic, positive, full of hope, etc.
","Students may read the first two sentences of the passage, which state a serious problem, and conclude that the overall tone is negative or pessimistic.

Students may identify the tone as neutral, serious, or concerned.

ELA,3,"While the phrase ""mind control"" may conjure up images of movie supervillains, mind control is not simply science fiction. In fact, the United States' government has, at various points in time, conducted research on the potential for mind control. Perhaps the most notorious example is the sinister-sounding Project MKUltra. Developed by the CIA in the 1950s, MKUltra focused on how to best interrogate suspects and prisoners. The project focused on various forms of brainwashing and manipulation, which included such techniques as sensory deprivation and hypnosis. As if these methods were not terrible enough, CIA researchers also studied the use of mind-altering drugs to control suspects’ thinking and behavior. Hoping to find new interrogation techniques for a potential war against the Soviet Union, agents administered these drugs without the suspects’ knowledge or permission. Participants suffered horrifying treatment, and several—including an Army officer—died as a direct result of the experiments.

ELA,5,"1. At the aquarium, Wilson had been tasked with an important mission: designing interesting toys to keep the intelligent octopus occupied. ""If they have nothing to do, they become bored,"" Bill explained. And boring your octopus is not only cruel; it's a hazard. I knew from living with two border collies and a 750-pound pet pig that to allow a smart animal to become bored is to court disaster. They will invariably come up with something creative to do with their time that you don't want them to do. [...]

2. To avert disaster, aquarium staff carefully design escape-proof lids to their octopus tanks and try to invent ways to keep their octopuses occupied. In 2007, the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo put together an enrichment handbook for octopus, filled with ideas of how to keep these smart creatures entertained. Some aquariums hide food inside a Mr. Potato Head and let the octopus dismantle the toy. Others offer Legos. Oregon State University's Hatfield Marine Science Center has devised a contraption that allows an octopus to create art by moving levers that release paint onto a canvas—which is then auctioned to generate funds to maintain the octopus tank.

How does paragraph 2 develop the idea that it’s important to prevent an octopus from becoming bored?
","Correct answers will recognize that paragraph 2 provides lists examples of creative ways that people keep octopuses entertained and prevent them from becoming bored. 
","It gives examples of ways aquarium staff keep octopuses entertained.

ELA,6,"When my family first moved to California, we were awed by our new surroundings. My sisters and I could see a sliver of ocean from the window of the bedroom we shared, and we loved to bike down to the beach to collect shells or listen to the waves crashing against the rocks. When they could scrape together bus fare for five, my parents would take us to the Golden Gate Bridge, where we would feed stale bread to the gulls and watch as the sun sank into the Pacific and the sky changed from pale blue to cornflower to indigo. But mostly, we girls were on our own. Our parents spent long hours at the restaurant they ran with my uncle, trying to entice customers with two-for-one specials and free drink refills.

ELA,7,"From their masterful camouflage to their ability to squeeze through tight spaces, octopuses are fascinating creatures. They show their intelligence by solving puzzles, opening jars, and navigating mazes. In one study, scientists even observed octopuses gathering coconut shells to use as shelters at the bottom of the ocean floor. The creatures used their tentacles to collect two halves of coconut shells and carried them beneath their bodies, walking awkwardly as though they were on stilts. When they encountered an open space or possible threat, they used the coconut shells as a protective shield by closing the halves over themselves. What makes this so special? Saving a tool for future use is considered an advanced function for a species and is observed in only a few other animals, like dolphins and elephants. Octopuses have yet another skill to add to their already impressive resumes!

ELA,8,"The Earth is dying. Between climate change, pollution, and resource depletion, the future of life on this planet is uncertain. Could the solution be to make our home on a new planet? While it may be tempting to solve our problems on Earth by simply moving to a new planet, the complexities of developing a new planetary home make migrating off-planet an unrealistic option.

The process of transforming an inhospitable planet into a habitable world is known as terraforming. It involves changing a planet's atmosphere, temperature, surface, and ecology to mirror those of Earth. Currently, the most popular candidate for terraforming is Mars, due to its closeness and similarities to Earth. However, terraforming Mars would require resources and technology that we don't currently possess—indeed, we don't even have the technology to send a single human to Mars! 

Furthermore, terraforming poses ethical dilemmas. Some argue that planets should be left in their natural, undisturbed state. Others claim that a desire to preserve uninhabited planets shouldn't trump the needs of billions of life forms here on Earth.

Terraforming is an exciting possibility, but its realities are complex. We would be better off dedicating time and effort to protecting and healing this planet, rather than finding ourselves a new one.

Part A: What is the author’s primary argument? 

Part B: What is one piece of evidence that the author includes to support their primary argument?
","Correct answers to Part A will recognize that the author’s primary argument is that settling a new planet is not a viable solution to environmental problems on Earth.

ELA,9,"The Silk Road, a system of trade routes that changed the course of history, extended over 4,000 miles from ancient China to the Mediterranean Sea. From around 200 B.C.E. to 1453 C.E., the Silk Road allowed people from Asia, the Middle East, and parts of Africa and Europe to trade goods like silk, tea, spices, cloth, and jade. This ancient superhighway facilitated the exchange not only of goods, but of groundbreaking ideas and inventions as well. Paper, which was invented in China, spread to the West via the Silk Road. Paper was introduced into Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries, revolutionizing communication by making writing materials cheaper and more widely available. The compass was another invention that traveled the Silk Road, leading to its widespread use. Having a compass was like having a tiny treasure map that could guide merchants and explorers across the vast, unpredictable terrain of the ancient world. The Silk Road was even responsible for the spread of different religions and philosophies. Buddhism, now one of the major religions of East Asia, was introduced to China by Buddhist monks traveling along the Silk Road. The Silk Road made possible an exchange of goods and ideas that shaped not only the ancient world, but also our own.

Anticipating her arrival, her appliances whirred into gear, performing a machine ballet that resulted in a breakfast sandwich, steaming hot, pirouetting onto a plate just as she stepped into the kitchen. She summoned a DrivePod, and as she sat on her building’s stoop, sandwich in hand, she noticed her neighbor step outside. At least, she assumed he was her neighbor. He looked vaguely familiar, but they'd never spoken.

She tried to say hello, but he didn't acknowledge her. Understandable, she thought. It was impossible for him to distinguish her from the background images in his ad-supported Alternative-Reality display. In his field of vision, her face was covered by an ad for dishwasher tablets. She could see the ad projected on the screen of his translucent headset. Her DrivePod arrived, and she climbed into the foam seat, which molded around her in a way that was both immobilizing and unsettling.
