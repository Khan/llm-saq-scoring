ELA,8,562,"Part A: We would be better off healing Earth than terraforming another planet.
Part B: The Earth is dying. Between climate change, pollution, and resource depletion, the future of life on this planet is uncertain. Could the solution be to make our home on a new planet? While it may be tempting to solve our problems on Earth by simply moving to a new planet, the complexities of developing a new planetary home make migrating off-planet an unrealistic option.

The process of transforming an inhospitable planet into a habitable world is known as terraforming. It involves changing a planet's atmosphere, temperature, surface, and ecology to mirror those of Earth. Currently, the most popular candidate for terraforming is Mars, due to its closeness and similarities to Earth. However, terraforming Mars would require resources and technology that we don't currently possessindeed, we don't even have the technology to send a single human to Mars!

Furthermore, terraforming poses ethical dilemmas. Some argue that planets should be left in their natural, undisturbed state. Others claim that a desire to preserve uninhabited planets shouldn't trump the needs of billions of life forms here on Earth.

Terraforming is an exciting possibility, but its realities are complex. We would be better off dedicating time and effort to protecting and healing this planet, rather than finding ourselves a new one.",0,0,0,0
